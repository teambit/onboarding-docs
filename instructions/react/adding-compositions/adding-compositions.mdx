Bit supports rendering your component in isolation which works as your local development environment. You can have multiple compositions per component to showcase different use cases, themes etc.

> Adding compositions to a component is done by creating a file in the component's directory, using the `*.composition.*` pattern.

For example:

```bash {3}
button
├── button.composition.tsx
├── button.tsx
└── index.ts
```

You can create various compositions to showcase different usages of your component.

Basic Button:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './button';

export const BasicButton = () => {
  return <Button text="click me" />;
};
```

Primary Button:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './button';

export const PrimaryButton = () => {
  return <Button type="primary" text="click me" />;
};
```
